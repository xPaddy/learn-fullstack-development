2. How do you pass a prop into a component?



3. Can I pass a custom prop (e.g. `blahblahblah={true}`) to a native
   DOM element? (e.g. <div blahblahblah={true}>) Why or why not?
   


4. How do I receive props in a component?
function Navbar() {
    return (

            ...
        </header>
    )
}
